Add a form that let's you pick launch velocity and adds a probe to the scene near the planets surface with that velocity
I suggest you make probes be an array on Scene
Suggest you start with Scene.launchProbe(fromSurfaceOf, velocity)
Add UI after backend is solid

Start on surface
Surface=radius, yeah


Convert Mars and Moon to es6 classes  COMMIT
Extract shared code from Mars/Moon -> CelestialBody class with inheritance
in scene constructor add planet and moon to this.bodies array [];
refactor set*position into CelestialBody class
remove unnecessary references to planet/moon using this.bodies instead.
